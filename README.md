# VELOCITY

1.Introduction
Directions have become an essential part of our daily live. Google maps controls our navigation to work, school,
Cafe or from these places at large. A major problem is that it does not allow for natural human social interaction. We use it 
to get to places but not to get to other people. This is where velocity comes in. Using Google maps API, velocity allows addition of 
descriptive details about our locations allowing our friends and family to easily reach us. It also allows for the average teacher 
easily mark his/her register automatically through calculation of proximity to the venue of study. This reduces the problem of misdirections
and saves study and lecture time for both lecturers and students.

2.About the project
The web application is a server side inclined made by the flask framework. Pure HTML and CSS  has been used in the 
frontend design of the UI. Sqlite database has also been configured to handle storage of user data. The data is analysed in some cases
to generate charts used to potray a users performance in a certain field Eg class attendance
